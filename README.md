# port-scanner
scans the ports of the target and tells you if it's open or not.

#how to work
when you run it, it will demand you to put the target or targets (if its multiple seperate them by ",")
then you enter the number of ports for scan and it starts scanning.

# warnings
this is simple scan and it is faster than nmap's default scan. I don't recommend you to use it on targets without premission (because it has heavy footprint).
good for beginners that want to scan metadisploit or local machines for test.
